This section has been created to include the 3D part designs of the project. Throughout the development process, the project has evolved significantly over time, which has led to multiple changes and improvements in the designs. The files presented here correspond to the final versions of the parts.
Additionally, I have attached some images showing the initial design concepts to illustrate how the project has progressed from its early ideas to the final result.
