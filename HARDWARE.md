## ⚡ Power Considerations

### 📊 Power Budget
- 🍓 Raspberry Pi 4: ~3W (600mA @ 5V)
- 🎛️ RGB Matrix HAT: ~0.5W (100mA @ 5V)
- 🟥 64x64 LED Matrix (full white): ~20W (4000mA @ 5V)
- 🟨 64x64 LED Matrix (typical usage): ~10W (2000mA @ 5V)
- 🖥️ LCD Display: ~0.5W (100mA @ 5V)
- 🎧 USB Audio Interface: ~0.5W (100mA @ 5V)

**Total:** ⚖️ ~15W typical, 🚨 ~25W maximum

## 🔌 Power Supply Recommendations
- Use separate 🔋 5V 4A supply for LED matrix (via RGB Matrix HAT)
- Raspberry Pi can be powered from HAT's barrel jack
- Or use official Raspberry Pi 15W USB-C power supply
  
## ⚠️ Safety Notes
- 🚫 Never exceed voltage ratings
- 🧯 Use fuses on all power inputs
- 🌍 Ensure proper grounding
- 🔇 Keep high-power audio circuit isolated
- 🧰 Use insulated connectors and enclosures
