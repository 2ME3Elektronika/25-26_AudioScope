# STEPS TO ASSEMBLY THE AUDIOSCOPE

## PRE-ASSEMBLY & PREPARATION
Before starting the physical construction, ensure you have completed these essential preparatory steps:

### 1. Software Configuration
It is highly recommended to configure the "brain" of the project before mounting it in the cage:
* **Flash the OS:** Install Raspbian (Lite version recommended) on your SD card.
* **Enable Interfaces:** Use `raspi-config` to enable **I2C** (for the OLED and sensors) and **I2S** (for the audio input).
* **Install Libraries:** Pre-install the drivers for the LED Matrix and the visualizer software to test components individually.

### 2. Safety & Tools
* **Soldering:** You will need a soldering station, solder, and heat shrink tubing to insulate the AC connections (L/N).
* **Chemical Bonding:** Ensure you have **Acetone** and a small brush if you are using ABS/ASA for the 3D parts.
* **Safety Warning:** This project involves **High Voltage (AC)**. Always disconnect the power supply from the wall before handling internal wiring.

## 3D CAGE
[3D Printed Parts Directory](https://github.com/2ME3Elektronika/25-26_AudioScope/tree/19ac5f9debe1980ef2535abc0a953aee821c8050/3D%20cage/3D%20printed%20parts)

Through the previously provided link, the necessary parts to assemble the box that will contain all the project components are available.

To join the required pieces, acetone was used as the bonding agent.
