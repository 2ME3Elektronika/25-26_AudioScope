# STEPS TO ASSEMBLY THE AUDIOSCOPE

## 3D CAGE
(https://github.com/2ME3Elektronika/25-26_AudioScope/tree/19ac5f9debe1980ef2535abc0a953aee821c8050/3D%20cage/3D%20printed%20parts)

Through the previously provided link, the necessary parts to assemble the box that will contain all the project components are available.

To join the required pieces, acetone was used as the bonding agent.

## COMPONENT ASSEMBLY 
Once the cage is complete, the next step is to assemble all the components in the link below.
